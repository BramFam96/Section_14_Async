Part One: Solidify Terminology

1)
HTTP is the standard that clients and servers use to communicate with eachother.
2)
A URL is a namespace that is used to reference a specific address on a network;
3)
DNS is the service that takes a URL namespace and translates it into an IP address.
4)
A query string is what we pass to our GET methods in order to specify the response we are looking
for from a server;
5)
GET - a common method used to specify and retrieve data from a server;
POST - a common method used to specify and store data in a server;
6)
An HTTP request is what we send in a GET method; it is what specifies the information
we are looking to get back from the server;
7) 
An HTTP response is the data we receive from the request we specified;
8)
An HTTP header contains pertinent information which varies between requests and responses;
Request headers contain params that pertain to the client requesting data; 
This includes Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie etc;
Response headers contain pertinent information relating to the server and data itself;
This includes Content-type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie
9)
When we type a URL in the browser, DNS translates this URL into an IP address;
Our browser then sends a request to this IP address;
The server at the IP address responds to our request;
The browser builds the DOM in the order the data is received;
New HTTP requests are made for each external resource; 
The steps above repeat until all data is loaded;

Part Two: Practice Tools

1)
curl https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=pirate
2) dig icanhazdadjoke.com -> 104.21.37.176 && 172.67.211.64;
3) I use liveserver..
