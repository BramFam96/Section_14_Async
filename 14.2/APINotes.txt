Application Program Interfaces (APIs) are what programs use to talk to eachother;

The data in these APIs are far condensed than say, the data we typically interact with when
visiting a site. That is say, they do not respond with HTML like a client-server response might;

Instead they respond with XML or JSON (JSON is the one we want to use)
XML - formatted data like HTML but the tags are the keys in our object:
<person> 
<name>Matt</name> 
<favColor>Gold</favColor>
</person>
JSON - looks like JS objects with a few key distinctions;
{ 
    "person": {
        "name":"Matt",
        "favColor":"Gold",
        "favNum":7,
        "hobby":["coding","cooking"]
    }
};
-> keys must use double quotes;
Rather than deal with nuanced differences between JSON and JS objects,
we can easily convert them into eachother;

If you do need to read through JSON we have a resource for make it palletable:
**Resource: chrome jsonview extension;
