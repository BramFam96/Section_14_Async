Ajax is a JS technique for making asynchronous requests;
This section will focus on 3 goals:

1) Comparing Ajax request to browser requests;
2) Making JS get and post requests with the help of axios;
3) Using async/await to manage asynchronicity;

Traditional Requests:
Happen in browser as a result of entering a url, clicking a link, submitting a form, etc;
These requests replace the content on our page, causing it to refresh;
-> JS could not get or set data itself;

Ajax Requests:
Also send and receive responses, but with Javascript; this allows us to load data in the bground;
this means we can load and use data to update a page without refreshing it;

Ajax techniques allow us to make use of small response packets that are critical to interactivity, 
scalability, and general performance; Accessability can be an issue;

Raw ajax can be clunky and confusing so we'll use a tool called Axios to simplify things:
